			question: "Can a friend withdraw the money I raise for them?",
			text: `
			Yes. AbegHelp.me makes it easy for another friend or family member to
			securely access the funds you have raised. Through AbegHelp.me, they
			will receive direct access to the money you have raised. Please note:
			You will not be able to enter their bank information during the
			withdrawal process; they will need to do this themselves.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Are there any deadlines or time limits?",
			text: `
			While there are important withdrawals deadlines you'll need to
			observe to avoid donations being refunded to donors, your fundraiser
			will remain live until you choose to turn off donations or remove the
			fundraiser altogether. Most organizers leave their fundraisers active
			indefinitely to refer back to the kind comments and support they
			received.`,
		},
		{
			question: "What if I do not reach my goal?",
			text: `
			No problem. Reaching your goal is not required. With AbegHelp.me, you
			keep each and every donation you receive. Your fundraiser will be able
			to accept donations even after your goal is reached. Once the goal is
			reached, the progress meter on your fundraiser will show that you have
			received more than your goal amount. If you'd like to continue
			raising money, you can keep your fundraiser running for as long as
			you'd like.`,
		},
		{
			question: "How do I get donations?",
